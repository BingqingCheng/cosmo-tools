Citation analysis tools based on scholarpy
==========================================

The package is composed of a script that uses scholarpy 
(github version needed as of June 2019) to download citation
data from Google scholar, and of a Jupyer nb making plots
from those. 

Usage:
```
fetch_citations.py "Author Name" > citation_data.json
```
