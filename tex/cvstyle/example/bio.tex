\section{Biography}
After a MSc in Materials Science from the University of Milan - Bicocca,
I obtained a Ph.D. in Physics from ETH Zürich, under the supervision of
Prof. Michele Parrinello. I spent three years in Oxford as a Junior
Research Fellow at Merton College, funded from a Royal Society Newton
Fellowship and a Marie Curie Fellowship, collaborating with Prof. David
Manolopoulos.
Since 2013 I work as an assistant professor at the Institute of
Materials at EPFL, leading the laboratory for Computational Science and
Modeling.
I have been awarded the IBM Research Forschungspreis in 2010, the Volker
Heine Young Investigator Award in 2013, and the IUPAP C10 Young Scientist
Prize in 2018, and obtained more than 5M€ in competitive funding,
including an ERC Starting Grant in 2016.
I published more than 90 peer-reviewed articles, that collected more than
3300 citations, and was invited to give more than 100 invited talks, between
conferences and departmental seminars.
