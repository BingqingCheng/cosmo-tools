\section{Research Interests}
My research focuses on the development of methods to understand
the structure and dynamics of complex condensed-matter systems,
and on their applications in fields that range from materials
science to organic chemistry and biology. I develop machine-learning
techniques that can be used to predict the structure-property relations
of materials, as well as to analyze the high-dimensional data resulting
from the simulation of complex systems. I also perform molecular
dynamics simulations that make it possible to extract thermodynamic and
time-dependent properties of materials at finite-temperature, including
also quantum mechanical effects such as zero-point energy and tunnelling.
I apply these and related methods to aqueous and hydrogen-bonded systems,
surface science problems, the determination of interface free energies,
and the study of metallic alloys.
